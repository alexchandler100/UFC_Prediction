In this repository, we have a scripts folder, a data folder, and an ML folder. 
In the scripts folder, we have python code for a web-scraper that scrapes ufcstats.com for fight data. 
In the data folder, we have the result of that scrape in the form of a csv file. The ML folder contains python code for applying a machine learning algorithm to predict fights based on the data in the data folder.
